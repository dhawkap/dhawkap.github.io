resume_header_intro: "<p>Hello! I'm a first year MSc student in Computer Science at the University of Calgary.
I am co-supervised by Dr Helen Ai He and Dr Wesley Willett from the Interactions Lab.
I am interested in Data Visualization (VIS) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research that focuses on how
demographic data visualizations can be used to further equitable processes at institutions.
Specifically, I explore how visualization tools can support advocates for equity and inclusion to provoke conversations
about equity (or lack thereof) within institutional hiring processes.
I have a BA in Computer Science from Colgate University. I am from the small tropical island of Mauritius
and outside of research, I like crochet, baking and the beach. </p>"
